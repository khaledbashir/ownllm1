  # REMOVED: n8n, redis, and browserless services
  # Reason: User self-hosts n8n on Easypanel at basheer-n8n.5jtgcw.easypanel.host
  # AnythingLLM connects via MCP (see anythingllm_mcp_servers.json)
  # Playwright (installed in container) handles all production web scraping
  # browserless was only for agent test lab (development feature)
