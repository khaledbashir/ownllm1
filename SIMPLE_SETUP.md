# SUPER SIMPLE Setup Guide 🚀

**Don't worry about the technical stuff. Here's what YOU need to do:**

## Step 1: Install the Tools (One Click)

**You do NOT need to download anything as an app.**

1. Go to your **Easypanel website** (where you manage your website)
2. Click on your **project name**
3. Look for a button that says **"Console"** or **"Terminal"**
4. Click it - this opens a text window where you type commands

## Step 2: Copy and Paste This Command

In that text window, copy and paste this EXACT line:
```
npm install puppeteer docx
```

Then press **Enter**. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to finish (it will show lots of text scrolling).

## Step 3: Create a Folder

Type this command and press Enter:
```
mkdir -p tmp/documents
```

## Step 4: Test It Works

Type this command and press Enter:
```
cd server/utils/documentProcessor && node testWorkflow.js
```

If you see green text saying "✅ All tests completed successfully!" then you're good!

## That's It! 🎉

**What you just did:**
- Installed the document processing tools (like installing an app, but for code)
- Created a folder to save your processed documents
- Tested that everything works

## How to Use It Now

### Option A: Use the Website Feature (Easiest)

1. Go to your website (the one hosted on Easypanel)
2. Look for a "Document Processing" section or button
3. Paste your raw proposal text
4. Click "Process Document"
5. Download your clean, professional document

### Option B: If You Don't See That Feature Yet

The code is ready in your system, but you need to add it to your website. You can:
1. Ask a developer friend to add the feature to your website
2. Hire someone to integrate it
3. Contact me and I can help you add it

## What This Will Do for You

**BEFORE:** You paste ugly, broken proposal text with bullets that don't work, tables that look terrible, and missing information.

**AFTER:** You get a beautiful, professional proposal document that looks like it came from a high-end agency.

## If Something Goes Wrong

**If you get a red error message:**
1. Don't panic - this is normal
2. Try running the commands again
3. If it still doesn't work, just message me

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Opened Easypanel Console
- [ ] Ran `npm install puppeteer docx`
- [ ] Ran `mkdir -p tmp/documents`
- [ ] Ran the test command
- [ ] Saw "All tests completed successfully!"

**If all checkboxes are ✅ you're done!**

## Next Steps

Once the setup is complete, you can:

1. **Start using it immediately** if the feature is already on your website
2. **Add the feature to your website** (I can help with this)
3. **Process your first document** and see the amazing difference

**The hard part is over. Now you just use it like any other website feature!** 🎯

**Remember:** You don't need to understand how the code works. You just needed to install it, and now it's ready to make your proposals look amazing!
